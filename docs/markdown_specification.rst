Markdown spec
=============

Introduction
------------

md_toc aimes to be as conformant as possible to each supported markdown 
parser. What follows is a list of parameters and rules used by md_toc to decide
how to parse markdown files and to generate the table of contents.

Supported markdown parsers
--------------------------

- ``cmark``:

  - https://github.com/commonmark/cmark

- ``commonmarker``

  - https://github.com/gjtorikian/commonmarker
  - https://www.gjtorikian.com/commonmarker/

  A "Ruby wrapper for libcmark (CommonMark parser)". As described on their 
  website: "It also includes extensions to the CommonMark spec as documented in 
  the GitHub Flavored Markdown spec, such as support for tables, 
  strikethroughs, and autolinking.". For this reason we assume that
  ``commonmarker`` is an alias of ``github``.

- ``github`` uses a forked version of ``cmark`` with some added extensions:

  - https://github.com/github/cmark

  The extensions used in GitHub Flavored Markdown should not concern
  md_toc. For this reason we assume that ``cmark`` is an alias of ``github``
  in md_toc.

- ``gitlab``:

  Used ``redcarpet`` with minor modifications and now uses ``commonmarker``. 
  Older versions of md_toc, prior to version 3.0.0, use ``gitlab`` as an alias 
  of ``redcarpet`` while newer versions use ``github`` instead. The extensions 
  used in GitLab Flavored Markdown (not to be confused with GitHub Flavored 
  Markdown) should not concern md_toc. For this reason we assume that 
  ``gitlab`` is an alias of ``github``.

- ``redcarpet``:

  - https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet

What are headers and what are not
---------------------------------

Only ATX-style headings are supported in md_toc.

- ``github``: the code used in md_toc is a reverse engineering of the 
  behavour described in the following:

  - https://github.github.com/gfm/#atx-heading

  The escape character ``\`` will be left as-is since they are parsed by 
  Github's markdown parser already:

  - https://github.github.com/gfm/#backslash-escapes

  A line ending character is ``U+000A`` or the ``U+000D`` character,
  respectively ``\n`` and ``\r``. Everything following those characters
  is ignored. This has also the benefit to automatically remove
  the trailing newline or carriage return at the end of each line. This also
  includes ARX headers with line endings only as main content, such as
  ``#\n`` or ``#\r``. See also:

  - https://github.github.com/gfm/#line
  - https://github.github.com/gfm/#line-ending

  Every other rule for ATX headings is applied.

- ``redcarpet``:

List item rules
---------------

We are interested in sublists indentation rules for all types of lists, and 
integer overflows in case of ordered lists.

For ordered lists, we are not concerned about using ``0`` or negative numbers 
as list markers so these cases will not be considered. Infact ordred lists 
generated by md_toc will always start from ``1``.

Talking about indentation rules, I need to mention that the user is responsible 
for generating a correct markdown list according to the parser's rules. Let's 
see this example:


  ::

     # foo
     ## bar
     ### baz


no problem here because this is rendered by md_toc, using ``github`` as parser, 
with:


  ::

     - [foo](#foo)
       - [bar](#bar)
         - [baz](#baz)


Now, let's take the previous example and reverse the order of the lines:


  ::

     ### baz
     ## bar
     # foo


and this is what md_toc renders using ``github``:


  ::


    - [baz](#baz)
    - [foo](#foo)
    - [bar](#bar)


while the user might expect this:


  ::


        - [baz](#baz)
      - [foo](#foo)
    - [bar](#bar)


- ``github``: 

  List indentation with this parser is always based on the previous state, as 
  stated in the GitHub Flavored Markdown document, at section 5.2:

    "The most important thing to notice is that the position of the text after the 
    list marker determines how much indentation is needed in subsequent blocks in 
    the list item. If the list marker takes up two spaces, and there are three 
    spaces between the list marker and the next non-whitespace character, then 
    blocks must be indented five spaces in order to fall under the list item."

  - https://github.github.com/gfm/#list-items

  Ordered list markers cannot exceed ``99999999`` according to the following. 
  If that is the case, a ``GithubOverflowOrderedListMarker`` exception 
  is raised:

  - https://github.github.com/gfm/#ordered-list-marker
  - https://spec.commonmark.org/0.28/#ordered-list-marker

- ``redcarpet``:

  Apparently there are no cases of ordered list marker overflows:

  - https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/blob/8db31cb83e7d81b19970466645e899b5ac3bc15d/ext/redcarpet/markdown.c#L1529  


Link label rules
----------------

If the user decides to generate the table of contents with the anchor links,
then link label rules will be applied.

- ``github``:

  - https://github.github.com/gfm/#link-label

  If a line ends in 1 or more '\' characters, this disrupts the anchor
  title. For example ``- [xdmdmsdm\](#xdmdmsdm)`` becomes 
  ``<ul><li>[xdmdmsdm](#xdmdmsdm)</li></ul>`` instead of 
  ``<ul><li><a href="xdmdmsdm">xdmdmsdm\</a></li></ul>``.
  The workaround used in md_toc is to add a space character at the end of the 
  string, so it becomes: ``<ul><li><a href="xdmdmsdm">xdmdmsdm\ </a></li></ul>``

  If the link label contains only whitespace characters a ``GithubEmptyLinkLabel``
  exception is raised.

  If the number of characters inside the link label is over 999 a 
  ``GithubOverflowCharsLinkLabel`` is raised.

  If the headers contains ``[`` or ``]``, these characters 
  are treated with the following rules.

  - https://github.github.com/gfm/#link-text
  - https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-302
  - https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-496

  According to a function in the source code, balanced square brackets do not
  work, however they do when interpeted by the web interface. It is however 
  possible that they are supported within the ``handle_close_bracket`` 
  function.

  - https://github.com/github/cmark/blob/6b101e33ba1637e294076c46c69cd6a262c7539f/src/inlines.c#L881
  - https://github.com/github/cmark/blob/6b101e33ba1637e294076c46c69cd6a262c7539f/src/inlines.c#L994


  Here is the original C function with some more comments added:

  .. highlight:: c

  ::

        // Parse a link label.  Returns 1 if successful.
        // Note:  unescaped brackets are not allowed in labels.
        // The label begins with `[` and ends with the first `]` character
        // encountered.  Backticks in labels do not start code spans.
        static int link_label(subject *subj, cmark_chunk *raw_label) {
          bufsize_t startpos = subj->pos;
          int length = 0;
          unsigned char c;

          // advance past [
          //
          // Ignore the open link label identifier
          // peek_char simply returns the current char if we are
          // in range of the string, 0 otherwise.
          if (peek_char(subj) == '[') {
            advance(subj);
          } else {
            return 0;
          }

          while ((c = peek_char(subj)) && c != '[' && c != ']') {
            // If there is an escape and the next character is (for example) 
            // '[' or ']' then,
            // ignore the loop conditions.
            // If there are nested balanced square brakets this loop ends.
            if (c == '\\') {
              advance(subj);
              length++;

              // Puntuation characters are the ones defined at:
              // https://github.github.com/gfm/#ascii-punctuation-character
              if (cmark_ispunct(peek_char(subj))) {
                advance(subj);
                length++;
              }
            } else {
              advance(subj);
              length++;
            }
            // MAX_LINK_LABEL_LENGTH is a constant defined at
            // https://github.com/github/cmark/blob/master/src/parser.h#L13
            if (length > MAX_LINK_LABEL_LENGTH) {
              goto noMatch;
            }
          }

          // If the loop terminates when the current character is ']' then 
          // everything between '[' and ']' is the link label...
          if (c == ']') { // match found
            *raw_label =
                cmark_chunk_dup(&subj->input, startpos + 1, subj->pos - (startpos + 1));
            cmark_chunk_trim(raw_label);
            advance(subj); // advance past ]
            return 1;
          }

        // ...otherwise return error.
        // This label always get executed according to C rules.
        noMatch:
          subj->pos = startpos; // rewind
          return 0;
        }


  For simpleness the escape ``[`` and ``]`` rule is used.


- ``redcarpet``:

  - https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/blob/e3a1d0b00a77fa4e2d3c37322bea66b82085486f/ext/redcarpet/markdown.c#L998

  Lets inspect this loop (from https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/blob/e3a1d0b00a77fa4e2d3c37322bea66b82085486f/ext/redcarpet/markdown.c#L1017):

  .. highlight:: c

  ::

        /* looking for the matching closing bracket */
        for (level = 1; i < size; i++) {
            if (data[i] == '\n')
                text_has_nl = 1;

            else if (data[i - 1] == '\\')
                continue;

            else if (data[i] == '[')
                level++;

            else if (data[i] == ']') {
                level--;
                if (level <= 0)
                    break;
            }
        }

        if (i >= size)
            goto cleanup;


  The cleanup label looks like this:

  .. highlight:: c

  ::

            /* cleanup */
            cleanup:
                rndr->work_bufs[BUFFER_SPAN].size = (int)org_work_size;
                return ret ? i : 0;


  .. highlight:: python

  An example: ``[test \](test \)`` becomes ``[test ](test )`` instead of
  ``<a href="test \">test \</a>``

  Infact, you can see that if the current character is ``\\`` then the the 
  current iteration is skipped. If for any chance the next character is ``]`` 
  then the inline link closing parenthesis detection is ignored. ``i`` becomes
  equal to ``size`` eventually and so we jump to the ``cleanup`` label.
  That lable contains a return statement so that string is not treated as 
  inline link anymore. A similar code is implemented also for
  detecting ``(`` and ``)``. See:

  - https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/blob/e3a1d0b00a77fa4e2d3c37322bea66b82085486f/ext/redcarpet/markdown.c#L1088
  - https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/blob/e3a1d0b00a77fa4e2d3c37322bea66b82085486f/ext/redcarpet/markdown.c#L1099

  To solve this we use the same workaround used for ``github``.


Anchor link types and behaviours
--------------------------------

- ``github``: a translated version of the Ruby algorithm is used in md_toc. 
  The original one is repored here: 
  
  - https://github.com/jch/html-pipeline/blob/master/lib/html/pipeline/toc_filter.rb

  I could not find the code directly responsable for the anchor link generation.

Notes about non implemented markdown parsers in md_toc
------------------------------------------------------

If you have a look at 
https://www.w3.org/community/markdown/wiki/MarkdownImplementations
you will see that there are a ton of different markdown parsers out there 
(moreover, that list has not been updated in a while).

Markdown parsers have different behaviours regarding anchor links. Some of them 
implement them while others don't; some act on the duplicate entry problem 
while others don't; some strip consecutive dash characters while others don't; 
and so on... For example:

- Gogs, Marked, Notabug, Gitea: Gogs uses marked as the markdown 
  parser while *NotABug.org is powered by a liberated version of gogs*.
  Gitea, a fork of Gogs, probably uses a custom parser. See link below.
  Situation is unclear. Here are some links:

  - https://gogs.io/docs
  - https://github.com/chjj/marked
  - https://github.com/chjj/marked/issues/981
  - https://github.com/chjj/marked/search?q=anchor&type=Issues&utf8=%E2%9C%93
  - https://notabug.org/hp/gogs/
  - https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea
  - https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/2a03e96bceadfcc5e18bd61e755980ee72dcdb15/modules/markup/markdown/markdown.go

  For this reason no implementation is available for the moment.

- Kramdown: It is unclear if this feature is available. See:

  - https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/search?q=anchor&type=Issues&utf8=%E2%9C%93


Steps to add an unsupported markdown parser
-------------------------------------------

1. Find the source code and/or documents.
2. Find the rules for each section, such as anchor link generation, title 
   detection, etc... Rely more on the source code than on the documentation (if 
   possible)
3. Add the relevant information on this page.
4. Write or adapt an algorithm for that section.
5. Write unit tests for it.
6. Add the new parser to the CLI interface.
