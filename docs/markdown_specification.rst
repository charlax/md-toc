Markdown spec
=============

Anchor link types and behaviours
--------------------------------

Since anchor links are a prominent feature of md_toc so some research was 
necessary to make sure that they work under all conditions.

Markdown parsers have different behaviours regarding anchor links. Some of them 
implement them while others don't; some act on the duplicate entry problem 
while others don't; some strip consecutive dash characters while others don't; 
and so on...

What follows is a list of parameters and rules used by md_toc to decide 
how to render anchor links. Note that only ``github``, ``redcarpet`` and 
``gitlab`` are currently implemented.

- ``github``: a translated version of the Ruby algorithm is used in md_toc. 
  The original one is repored here: 
  
  - https://github.com/jch/html-pipeline/blob/master/lib/html/pipeline/toc_filter.rb

  GitHub uses a forked version of cmark-gfm:

  - https://github.com/github/cmark

  I could not find the code directly responsable for the anchor link generation.

- ``redcarpet``: Treats consecutive dash characters by tranforming them into a 
  single dash character. A translated version of the C algorithm 
  is used in md_toc. The original version is here:

  - https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/blob/26c80f05e774b31cd01255b0fa62e883ac185bf3/ext/redcarpet/html.c#L274

- ``gitlab``: GitLab uses the Redcarpet parser with some modifications, such 
  as duplicate anchor link detection. A generic pseudocode is
  available here:

  - https://gitlab.com/help/user/markdown.md#header-ids-and-links
              
- ``gogs``, ``marked``, ``notabug``: Gogs uses marked as the markdown 
  parser while *NotABug.org is powered by a liberated version of gogs*. 
  Situation seems unclear. Here are some links:

  - https://gogs.io/docs
  - https://github.com/chjj/marked
  - https://github.com/chjj/marked/issues/981
  - https://github.com/chjj/marked/search?q=anchor&type=Issues&utf8=%E2%9C%93
  - https://notabug.org/hp/gogs/

  For this reason no implementation is available for the moment.

- ``kramdown``: It is unclear if this feature is available. See:

  - https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/search?q=anchor&type=Issues&utf8=%E2%9C%93


What are headers and what are not
---------------------------------

According to the GFM, there can be no more than 6 types of headings, ``h1`` to 
``h6`` in HTML terms, and there shall be from 0 to a 3 space indentation 
(optionally) for a text to be a header

  - https://github.github.com/gfm/#atx-heading

To avoid unexpected behaviours empty headers are ignored while building the 
table of contents. The GFM, however, allows empty headers:

  - https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-49

There are a lot of other special cases described on the GFM document.

Anyway, md_toc simplifies all this. A line is a header when:

  - it starts with a consecutive series of ``#`` characters which may go from 
    1 to infinite,
  - and, there shall be an unlimited number of indentation spaces between the 
    start of the line and the first ``#`` character,
  - and, there shall be an unlimited number of spaces between the 
    last ``#`` character and the header text,
  - and NOT, when there are whitespace characters only after the series of
    ``#`` characters.

md_toc's definition of header/heading is certainly not conformat with GFM and 
probably with the other markdown parsers as well (which may be also behave 
differrently compared to GitHub's cmark in this matter). Knowing what are 
headers and what are not requires going through the specific parts of the code 
of all the parsers.
