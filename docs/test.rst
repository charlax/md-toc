Testing
=======

Before running the tests you need to install the library's dependencies and,
if any, the ones listed here.

Now, run the following command in a terminal,

::

    $ python setup.py test

or simply

::

    $ make test

You can also add this command before every git commit as by running

::

    $ make githook
